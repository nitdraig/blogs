# The principles for remote teamwork - CASFF

Within the **CASFF** framework that I use in my projects when working in remote IT teams, I consider 5 principles that I want to tell you about today.

But first, what are principles?

- **According to Wikipedia: Principles are rules or norms that guide the action of a human being by changing the rational spiritual faculties.**

- **According to the RAE: Fundamental norm or idea that governs thought or behavior.**

- **According to Agustín: Intrinsic values ​​from which individual decision-making is based on the search for team survival and project success. (Definition oriented of course to these principles)\_**

With this clarified, let's start to see the principles.

- **Autonomy:** I consider it very important,
  That whatever the role of the team member is, they can have their own criteria to propose solutions and face challenges within the team, even when they do not have the necessary experience for certain solutions, they have the opportunity to search and propose ideas.

- **Alignment with vision:** Every project has a mission and vision, even though it is not entirely clear at first, I consider that it is essential to feel identified with the product/project/ideals and align yourself as much as possible. (I will emphasize this in another blog, stay tuned)

-**Trust:** In teams there doesn't have to be an I, it's a we. It is necessary to be able to trust the team,
colleagues and the shared vision about the project where we are seeking success.

- **Performance:** We are not always at 100%, for X or Y reason. Even so, a high level of demand is expected in the performance of each role and assigned activities. Focus on achieving what corresponds to us individually, in the best possible way for the good of the team.

- **Always Beta:** This is the most curious principle, it goes beyond what direct management would be, however in software projects it is necessary to understand that everything changes, everything can be improved and everything is subject to the obsolescence that accompanies the life of the Internet and its constant improvements. Innovation is constant and a product can always be improved. It does not mean looking for the 5th paw of the cat, simply accepting that the details can be polished and improved.

With these principles, explained at the beginning of each project with each team, I start the project.
In the next post next Friday I will talk about the values ​​that I try to ensure that the teams with which I collaborate always keep in mind, added to these principles they are a powerful weapon for group strength.

**Thank you very much for your time, have a great day. See you in the next post.**
