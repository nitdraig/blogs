# The Importance of Organizational Culture in Project Management
*Understanding the pre-existing culture in an organization is essential for any Project Manager. This module delves into how organizational culture directly impacts project management.*

***Culture in organizations:***
-
Organizational culture is defined by the values, objectives, mission and history of the organization, both of employees and executives. It is, in essence, "the personality of the organization."

***Importance of organizational culture:***

- Culture influences the way teams work and collaborate.
It impacts decision making and the implementation of strategies.

**Featured phrase:**

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast." -Peter Drucker

***This phrase emphasizes that without a strong and positive organizational culture, even the best strategy can fail. For PMs,
Understanding and aligning with the organization's culture is crucial to successfully leading projects.***

With this summary I conclude the learning posts of module 1 of the Google Project Management course.
I hope you have learned something and it is as useful to you as it was to me. 
Thanks for your time, see you in another article.
