# Reflections after my First Technical Tests for Fullstack Positions
Recently, I ventured to apply for two fullstack positions without meeting 100% of the required requirements.
Because? Partly because I don't think there is someone with that 100% and the number of years that I requested and on the other hand because I know that it is more of a filter than a need to be covered.

Although I was confident in my abilities, the lack of experience in this type of test caused me some fear.
I had never before reached the point where they asked me for a test to solve.
However, I decided to jump into the pool.

**My lessons are divided into two parts: for those seeking employment and for those offering positions.**

I will not go into details about the tests or interviews as I did not face any major problems.
From the beginning, I received cordial treatment and would be willing to repeat the process. However, there were two aspects that I consider should be improved:

- Lack of clear feedback.
- The fact of being ignored after the process.

If someone spends time doing an interview and a technical test,
You deserve to know why you were rejected. This may be because another candidate met expectations before, or perhaps made a serious mistake. Whatever the reason, I think it is important, out of respect for both the interviewee and the employing entity, to provide an answer.

+ Lessons for applicants:

* Don't fear rejection;
Many times, it is not something personal, but rather another candidate simply stood out a little more.
* Requirements are often less strict in practice than they appear on paper.
* Do not give up; They will eventually find someone who values ​​their skills, both technical and soft.

+ My request to recruiters:
*I understand that breaking bad news can be difficult, but providing feedback and reasons why a candidate didn't fit can help them improve and motivate them for future opportunities.
*Ghosting is discouraging and can make you feel inadequate. It is more constructive to keep the lines of communication open,
since the candidate could improve their skills and be an excellent option in the future.

I conclude by hoping that these reflections will be useful to you and that we will stay in touch in the future.
Kind regards.
