Currently, I consider it practically unimaginable to work without the support of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's not because you can't do it yourself, but because the use of AI simplifies weeks, months, and even years of software development, bug analysis,
Instant data processing and queries on various assumptions with just a few clicks and keystrokes.

The Process of Interacting with AI: Context, Request, Review, Comparison and Implementation

In the context*,
I detail the role that AI must assume and the specifications necessary to obtain the answer I am looking for. Then, in the *request*, I send the contextualized text for a more precise understanding.

In the *review* phase, I apply my knowledge to analyze, revise and recontextualize if necessary, waiting for an improved response.
*Comparison* is essential, as I review key details to evaluate both my prior knowledge of the topic and any previous answers, selecting the most appropriate one for my situation.

*Implementation* is the final step, where I integrate the "Ideal Answer" into the corresponding framework. However,
Clarity and precision are not the only criteria; Comparison with previous projects or contexts is crucial to ensure that the response is fully adapted to current needs
.

## **The Growing Importance of Artificial Intelligence**

The relevance of AI, although not always evident to everyone, is significant and constantly increasing. AI is conquering all areas that require analytical thinking, speed and contextualization of tasks.

In the near future, I predict that AI will be ubiquitous,
intervening in every corner of the city, in every section of the internet and in every business or government decision where prior data exists and it is possible to predict, even in percentage terms, the future.

***Conclusion***
I appreciate your time and I hope that this reflection on the importance of Artificial Intelligence has been useful to you. See you in the next entry, where we will explore together new facets of this fascinating technological world.

Thank you very much for your attention and see you soon!
