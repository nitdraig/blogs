I have dedicated approximately 3 years to studying and immersing myself in the fascinating world of programming and information technology. My first steps included forays into areas such as hacking, web development and the strategic use of the Internet to obtain quality information, all of which began at the age of 16 or 17. However,
It wasn't until I was 22 that I fully immersed myself in web development through the "Argentina Programa" bootcamp.

Before entering the field of programming, I was already interested and looking for courses in a wide variety of disciplines, from Photoshop, video editing, to accounting, administration, resource management,
fitness training and more. In fact, I still continue to explore different content and participate in various courses that, although not directly related to programming, enrich my skill set. That is why I consider self-education to be essential in any career you choose in life.
From programming to being a personal trainer, taking advantage of resources such as the internet, books and attending in-person courses related to your goals is essential. Although it is possible to acquire skills self-taught and survive in various areas,
It's crucial to elevate those skills to a level of quality that suits the demands of your future projects. In this sense, making use of modern tools provides a significant advantage compared to those who do not recognize their usefulness.

Soft skills, also known as "soft skills",
They are an integral part of the life of the autodidact. Therefore, it is very necessary to take control of your own education, and not limit yourself only to what is learned in a course, school or university. Constant learning and adaptability are key to thriving in any field,
and being aware of the importance of soft skills further expands the opportunities for success on the self-taught path.
