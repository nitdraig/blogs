# **Enjoying the Game: Reflections on a Competitive Achievement**
---------------------------
----------------------------

Four years and a few months ago, I embarked on a journey into a competitive 5v5 game. Recently, I achieved a small breakthrough in this game.
I want to defend the value of video games, not only from my perspective as a programmer and team leader, but as someone who has learned the importance of cooperation and teamwork to achieve a common goal.

### *Video Games as a Learning Tool*

Video games are often underrated, but they offer valuable lessons. It's not just about winning, but about moving forward despite the circumstances,
of not giving up in the face of the unforeseen, of fighting despite everything, and of knowing yourself to improve every day. These skills are transferable to many aspects of professional life, especially in software development and project management.

### *Lessons in Cooperation and Resilience*
Frustration is an inevitable part of daily life, but learning to count on others to move forward, fight and not give up is a direct lesson in competitiveness in video games. As a fullstack programmer and project manager, the ability to work effectively as a team and overcome obstacles is crucial.
Video games have taught me to value each member of the team, recognize their strengths and weaknesses, and work together to achieve our goals.

### *Respect and Sportsmanship*
Respecting the opponent, respecting the team, accepting defeat and, above all, enjoying the game beyond winning, are values ​​that I have internalized throughout this experience. In software development, as in video games, competition can be fierce,
but mutual respect and sportsmanship are essential for personal and professional growth.

### *Integrating Learning in the Professional World*
These experiences have not only made me a better player, but also a better professional. In my role as a project manager, I apply these lessons to foster a collaborative and resilient work environment. I value constant and constructive feedback, and I always seek to improve both individually and as a team.
