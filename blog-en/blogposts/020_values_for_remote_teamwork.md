# The Values ​​for Remote Teamwork - CASFF

Within the **CASFF** framework that I use in my projects when working in IT teams remotely, I propose 5 values; These are complemented by the principles mentioned above here.
The values ​​are based on the Crabi team handbook,
I took them from the Startupeable 035 podcast where Cristina Carvallo participates.

But what do values ​​mean in a team?

**- According to Wikipedia:** Quality of a subject or an object. Values ​​are added to physical or psychological characteristics.

**- According to the RAE:** Quality of a person or thing for which it is considered good,
useful or worthy of interest.

**- According to Agustín:** Principles on which constant work/action is based within a team of a person or group of people.

**Values ​​required in CASFF:**

**- Take risks:**
The ability to make mistakes quickly, learn from them and demonstrate what has been learned is valued.
Risk is always present in all types of projects, "Murphy's Law", therefore it is necessary to use risk in favor of the team, the project and individually.

**- Commitment:**
Keep your word. It is each member's responsibility to ask for help if they need it or feel stuck.
The person is worth more for what he does than for what he says, the value must be given to the word with the action, committing to the task must mean completing it in a timely manner.

**- Brutal Honesty:**
Transparency and sincerity are promoted in all interactions. Honesty without empathy is cruelty,
But this value means being direct and waiting for that relationship to return, that no one can always be right and it is always possible to do things better.

**- Open mentality:**
It is important to remain receptive to new ideas and approaches, avoiding closing yourself off to new possibilities.
Shutting down in the face of the constant change we face in the technology industry is condemning the team, the project, and oneself to irreparable failure. Always learn, always listen, always analyze and maintain the general opinion as a lighthouse, but not as a destiny.

**- Enjoy the picnic:**
Enjoying teamwork is encouraged,
the process and the experience as a whole.
What good would it do for us to win, complete or finish anything if we don't enjoy the journey?
Even if it is not a powerful project, if it is something simple, without many colors, without many functions, it is vital to enjoy the journey to complete it, for the team,
the project and the combined experience of all these factors.

These values ​​are vital for the optimal performance of a team; from time to time it is necessary to remind the team that they exist and encourage them to live them daily.

Without further ado, see you in the next post.

**_Thank you very much for your time, have a great day.
