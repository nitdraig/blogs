# Fighting the ego

We are intimately linked to our idea of ​​ourselves. Yes it seems redundant but...is it?

In this continuous learning process as a Project Manager, I learned a couple of things that I would love to contribute about the ego.

## **_Chapter 1 - me me - _**

Experience gives an undeniable intuition,
However, is this intuition irrefutable and unequivocal? The truth is that no, in general (my experience) it is right more than it is wrong. Managing my own ego is another process in managing teams, project development and life itself. It is very easy to get carried away by that trust, knowing how to take it as another risk in the project is important.

## **_Chapter 2 - ego vs ego - _**

Clashing with colleagues with big egos is extremely easy. It is not difficult to avoid it, although I consider it not good, this minimizes the character of any partner, making them feel hurt most likely.
Many times this collision is inevitable (There are people who need to trip over the stone to see it). I also learned that giving in is not necessarily giving in or giving up, sometimes the greater good is the key to success. Evaluating this is essential to finalize the path of a project.

## **_Chapter 3 - the example - _**

In recent projects, I found an action very interesting that I was able to carry out, very subtly, to offer a teammate a hug for his ego.
As? I gave him an important task that did not correspond directly to him but I knew that it would serve as a bridge to consolidate his own vision of himself,
In addition to providing extraordinary value, it accomplished this task successfully. She saw from that moment that her ego not only went down but she stopped colliding daily with her peers.

## **_Conclusion:_**

Live, and lets live. I understood that directing is giving the freedom to be accompanied at the same time.
