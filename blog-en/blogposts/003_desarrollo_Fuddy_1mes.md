## **Organizational challenges:**


For Fuddy he had planned a communication and organization framework in order to achieve ideal or less crude productivity.

*First*, continuous communication,
The challenge of developing in different parts of the world with limited time creates this need to maintain control and communication based on development that is continuous and changing in different factors.


*Second*, details of specific tasks,
In general the tasks are simple and concrete but there are tasks that require a unique level of specificity. Declaring the needs that you seek to solve, the areas that must be covered and the time in which it is necessary is a key point.


*Third*, the structure of the project, this is necessary for its readability,
A structure already in place accelerates review, correction and making new fundamental decisions.


*Fourth*, the cost of each member's time, not all tasks are essentially accomplishable in the same times,
The previous points make it easier for the project to advance elsewhere while a particular task is in development.

## Selected stack

- **WhatsApp**: for continuous communication.
- **Google Meet and Discord**: for meetings and demos.
- **Trello and Google Drive**: to organize tasks and store documentation.
- **Github**: to store the project code.

I hope this information be useful for you. See you next time.
