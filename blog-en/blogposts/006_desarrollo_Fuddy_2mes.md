In the second month of Fuddy development, we faced two crucial challenges: consolidating our communication channels and handling the departure of two team members. Although one of them left the project before its start, we were forced, due to time constraints and various reasons, to postpone the search for a replacement.
## *Reaffirming Communication Channels:*

Using the CASFF team management framework, designed to maximize agility and prevent potential communication setbacks (you can get more details in the post dedicated to this framework on this blog, *[here](https://en.blog.agustin.top/posts/004_framework_managment)*),
We managed to establish three essential channels: Trello, Whatsapp and Meet. These channels became our main avenues for sharing information about task progress and addressing any issues related to deadlines or set tasks.

The solution, although simple, was not easy to implement. In this project,
The team's participation was outside of work, so it was crucial to establish a fixed time and day for group meetings. Flexibility also played a key role: we used WhatsApp as an "informal" medium for constant communication, at any time, thus addressing various problems related to Fuddy. Trello,
On the other hand, it became a fundamental record for tasks, progress and workflows at each project milestone.

In short, flexibility became the unwavering ally of effective communication.

## *Overcoming the Exit of Key Members:* 

Firstly, I temporarily took over one of the vacant roles.
Although I am a programmer, my responsibilities at Fuddy were more oriented towards organizing and reviewing details, which consumed the extra time I could dedicate to the project, including managing the newsletter and monitoring various additional aspects, such as the website and the applications, etc.

Despite these challenges,
We managed to move forward without problems. The advantage was that the exits occurred in a not so advanced phase of the application's development. The lead replacement arrived quickly, fitting seamlessly into the team, workflow and culture we already had in place.

In summary of this point,
The prompt departure and pre-established structure for development allowed the project to continue without stalling.

*Eternal Gratitude:*

I want to express my eternal gratitude to all the team members who have dedicated their efforts to carry out this project, truly believing in its success.

That's all for today.
I wish you a great day, afternoon or night!

See you in the next installment.
