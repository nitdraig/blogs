# "The Life Cycle of a Project: From Initiation to Closure"
In the Project Management Fundamentals module, we learned about the basics and essentials of project management. The classes, with first-hand stories from members of different Google teams, are simple, direct, and easy to digest.
Here is a summary of the key points about the life cycle of a project:


## The life cycle of a project is divided into four fundamental stages:

*1. Project initiation:*

Determination of objectives, deliverables, resources and team selection.
Establishment of success criteria and project expectations.

*2.
Planning:*

Layout of a detailed plan, adjusted to the budget and available resources.
Definition of schedules, assignment of tasks and establishment of milestones.

*3. Execution and monitoring:*

Supervision of the fulfillment of tasks within the given time.
Provision of tools and resources necessary for the team.
Constant communication with stakeholders about progress.

*4. Project closure:*

Delivery and evaluation of results.
Documentation of lessons learned and recommendations for future projects.
These stages are essential to ensure that a project is completed successfully and within established parameters.
