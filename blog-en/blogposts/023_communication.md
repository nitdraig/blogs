# Concise Communication: less is more (Almost always)

Continuing with the KISS rule, which I talked about in my talk (in the previous post), I want to give my opinion about one of the most important aspects for any team that works under agile methodologies: _concise communication._
In the world of agile development, where time and efficiency are crucial, learning to communicate what is necessary and fair is a vital skill. It's not just about saving time, but about ensuring that each message is clear, direct and avoids misunderstandings (These 3 are the pinnacle of agile communication) that can delay the team's progress. In agile methodologies, speed ​​is important, but not at any cost. Keeping our communications simple helps us avoid overloading the team with unnecessary information or details that could cause confusion. The KISS rule (Keep It Simple, Stupid) not only applies to product or software design, but also to how we express ourselves.

## How do we achieve it?

- Let's be clear and direct: Let's avoid unnecessary decorations or technicalities. The goal is for the message to be understood the first time.
- Use short sentences: Long paragraphs tend to dilute the main message. Shorter, more concise sentences make it easier to understand.
- Straight for the jugular: In meetings or written communications, identify what the main message is and communicate it quickly.

## Let's avoid information overload

One of the common mistakes is assuming that the more information we give, the better the result will be. But in reality, too many details can delay work.
Agile teams thrive in environments where messages are clear, specific, and leave room for team members to make informed decisions independently.
Before communicating something, ask yourself: What is the main point I want to convey? If you can sum it up in a sentence or two, we're on the right track.

## Conclusion: Less is almost always more

Concise communication is not just a useful technique, it is a way of thinking (even living sometimes). In an agile environment, the team needs to flow, adapt and move fast.
If we master the art of saying only what is necessary, we optimize the work of our colleagues,
while building a culture of efficiency, clarity and productivity.
Remember, less is almost always more, and clear communication will always be a key tool to achieve objectives in any project.

Without further ado, thank you for your time, have a nice day.
