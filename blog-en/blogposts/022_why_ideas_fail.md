# Why do ideas fail? - Summary Talk

This article is a summary of the Talk at the Catamarca Technological Node on September 27, 2024, in which I participated as a guest speaker.

To create this talk I placed myself at the beginning of my career as an Entrepreneur, from the founding of Tinta Negra Studios, a roomstudio that I set up at home,
with which I recorded more than 100 songs by local artists; to my most recent experiences as a Freelance.

It was an incredible experience, very fruitful, I believe that I managed to convey what I was looking for and motivate those listening to the talk.

Now I want to share with you the key points we touched on in this talk.

##1.
Lack of clear bases: Mission and Vision

Every successful idea needs a solid foundation. A clear mission tells us why we do what we do, and the vision guides us where we want to go. Without these two foundations, it is easy to lose direction and motivation.

## 2. Todismo: Do ​​not delegate

One of the biggest mistakes is trying to do everything yourself.
This can lead to burnout and stagnation of ideas. Learning to delegate not only frees you, but also allows others to add value.

## 3. The beauty of rejection: NO as fuel

Rejection is an inevitable part of the journey. Instead of seeing it as an obstacle, we can use it as an opportunity to improve.
Every “no” is an opportunity for growth and learning.

## 4. The 3 fundamental laws

Thiel's Law: An idea must be 10 times better than what already exists, it is not enough to just be an incremental improvement.

Murphy's Law: Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Anticipating problems is key.

KISS (Keep It Simple,
Stupid): Keep the ideas simple. Complexity can be the enemy of progress.

## 5. Lukewarm leadership: The impact on management

Unclear or indecisive leadership can stall any project. A leader must be firm and make decisions that inspire confidence in the team.

## 6. The triple constraint: Scope, time and cost

It is not possible to maximize all variables in a project. Quality is the result of properly managing scope, time and cost. Making smart decisions in this balance is key to success.

# Do these points ensure the success of any project?

Nothing guarantees success.

True success is not in reaching the goal
, but about enjoying the journey and learning to overcome the challenges. The fun of the game is knowing that, even if everything is against us, we are capable of achieving it.

Without further ado, thank you for your time, have a nice day.
