## **On this journey recruiting for Fuddy, I have accumulated valuable lessons that I want to share.**

- **Enthusiasm vs. Knowledge:**
I discovered that in recruiting for my project, Fuddy, enthusiasm is worth more than technical knowledge. But let's not underestimate knowledge, it is the path that guides us.

- **Read and Follow Instructions:** Attention to details! During the recruiting process for Fuddy,
I noticed that people often don't read the instructions and waste unnecessary time.

- **Looking for the Ideal Team:** An ideal team is not found, it is built! At Fuddy, I learned that there is no pre-existing perfect team.

- **The Value of an Idea:** Ideas alone have no value.
What matters is the team behind them and their ability to learn and collaborate.

- **Ignore Unfounded Criticism:** We should not always pay attention to unfounded criticism. During the recruiting process for Fuddy, I was faced with uninformed opinions.

**Discovering Talent:** I found an abundance of talent, but presentation matters! In addition to skills, it is crucial to be clear about your goals before joining a project.
