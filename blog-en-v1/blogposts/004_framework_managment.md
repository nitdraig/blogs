***CASFF - Clear, agile, simple, fast, and flexible***

üí° **What is CASFF?**

## The remote management of a project covers various problems that, having to be faced, require the creation of this ‚ÄúFramework‚Äù that is simple, agile, and focused on not hindering the teams in their individual and group work process.
In the same way, cover all possible aspects in order to deliver a product that is as faithful to the original vision as possible, flexible to the budgets and capabilities of each of the team members.

üí°**Roles**

## This framework is designed for small teams, self-manageable and with capabilities in their respective areas greater than Junior.

- **Top (Project manager)**: Responsible for task assignment, distribution and administration of resources and monitoring.

- **Bot (SubManager)**: In case of excess tasks, saturation of guidelines and lack of correct communication, the Bot, designated by the Project Manager, will fulfill the assistant role. Being able to create, distribute,
correcting and being an intermediary between the PM and the rest of the team.

- **Ideator**: He is the ‚ÄúCreator‚Äù of the product idea, and may be a member of the team or external to it. His role is as a consultant on non-technical issues, more focused on the vision of the product.

-
**Tables (Engineers)**: Each area (those necessary according to the project) must have a main area manager, this role is in charge of each need, approach, error and order in it.

- **Table legs**: Team members who are not members of any of the previous roles will be part of this role,
They are under the orders of the engineers of their respective utility areas. They must adhere to the times, they can use the channels to communicate with the PM, SM in case of communication inconsistencies on the part of their area heads.

- **InterMid**: Consultants who are not a direct part of the team but whose suggestions,
Opinions and ideas are of high value to the team.


üí°**Ceremonies and events:**

## The aim is to reduce each meeting, conference, and distribution of tasks to the minimum necessary time. Establishing a maximum limit of weekly meetings, a time limit for them, and the distribution of participants' time is one of the PM's tasks.

- **Session**: 1, 2 or 3,
depending on the complexity of the project. The first to establish the mission and vision on a timeline. The second to distribute the tasks and the third to monitor them. No more than 60 minutes, the less the better.
    
    Everything is subject to the project, established times and the complexity to be faced.
    
-
**Extra Session**: these should be given only if the complexity of a topic warrants it, being mediated as much as possible by the PM.
- **Super Session**: a monthly meeting will be used to celebrate milestones and prepare the next points to work on and provide feedback to each area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.
- **RTG-Session**: the last meeting based on the product MVP, mention of milestones, acknowledgments and highlights of participants whose performance was significant.

üí°**Task design:**

The use of Kanban Board is proposed with the following order:


*Task list **-** Pending tasks - Tasks in progress - Completed tasks - Unfinished tasks*



**Task list**, possible tasks are previously organized.
In **pending tasks**, those necessary for the product are proposed.
In **tasks in development** the tasks that are in development are located, always having a simple title, a clear and specific description of the needs of the task and those responsible for it.

In **tasks performed** are those completed successfully,
Clarification is necessary in the event of any inconvenience overcome that has not been foreseen.

In **unfinished tasks**, the reasons for non-completion of each one must be clarified in great detail.

üí°**WorkFlow:**


*The order is used: **Approach - Time - Follow-up - Review - Delivery.***

1- **Approach:** the task is proposed, the needs it covers, the tools, the approach it should have and how it is intended to work.

2- **Time:** Once the approach is made, the time is established,
in favor of the need for the task in relation to the project, the capabilities of the team in charge and the tools they have at the moment.

3- **Monitoring:** Based on the established time, a follow-up is carried out to be determined by the PM based on the task and its different approaches.

4- **Review:** At the end of the time, or prior to this,
A review is carried out with the PM, the engineer in charge and, if necessary, the Ideator. To confirm the completion of the task.

5- **Delivery:** Although at this point it is assumed that the task would be ‚ÄúFinished‚Äù, the delivery does more than finalize it, it leaves it at the disposal of the testing and design area and with the mentality of ‚ÄúAlways- Beta".
The task fulfills its function but will always be open to improvement, fixing in case of errors or Bugs, and in view of the always-improvable need for the user experience.

Extras:

4.1) Retrospective: The team meets periodically for a retrospective and plans the next iterations, improvements and new additions.

4.2) **Testing:** Once approved, the task moves to the testing phase. If it fails, it is moved to "Not Completed" for investigation.

### Create this Framework to facilitate the management and explanation of the process in teams without much experience, in need of facing rapid development and seeking freedom in the same process.

It is subject to changes in the future, it is an idea to improve, if you have questions, suggestions or criticisms,
I am willing to hear them and take them into account.
