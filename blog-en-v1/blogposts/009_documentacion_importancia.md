# The importance of documentation in the development process
We imagine a new kind of hammer, this one has buttons, levers, and is almost independent of you.
That ALMOST is the difference between conventional and innovative, right?
Now it arrives at your house, in a beautiful package, you open it and decide that it is more useful for your brother than for you,
you give it to them. You go to his house and you forgot the package that contained him, however he loves the GPT hammer. You hand it to him, you talk for a while and you leave.
Do you know how I would start using it?
***To the blows.***
This could be avoided in any new system that has been developed on old ideas with new features in a simple way, ***DOCUMENTING. (Manual for the hammer)***

I understood it in one of the first projects outside of my control that I was part of, the lack of documentation, workflow,
Even with the best thought out project, it is almost impossible to carry out correctly.

Almost because you could do it individually and not explain your code to anyone as long as it works.

But if you work with teams you must be aware of your mortality, your possible absence at a key moment and the best way to be present without being present,
It is documenting.

From simple functions, to the structure of your code, the structure of your business, of your workflow.

Apply it in your side-projects, in your personal projects and you will notice how you not only avoid forgetting, but also establish the agile flow that you can use in the future.
And more than anything, your team will thank you.

Also remember,
Your documentation must also have a structure, an order, a logic.
