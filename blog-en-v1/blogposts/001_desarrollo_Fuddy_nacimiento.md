**How ​​is an idea born?**

Answering that question is complex, since the need to create is innate in the human species. Fuddy was born as a response not to a problem, but to a set of problems.

On my path as a developer (which I continue to travel), I realized that,
Instead of creating a simple project like a to-do list (TODO list) or other similar projects, which are not difficult and have information available on the Internet for structuring, it was better to create a product that really solved something.

Something as simple, obvious and neglected as food in this case.

So,
With a relatively simple idea, I decided to embark on the journey of assembling a team, establishing a framework, creating a network of contacts and taking my idea to the world. I began by structuring my idea, the solution I offered and the technical alternatives available at that time.
This is how I considered the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to offer already existing information in a digital format, such as an application (APP) and a web application (web APP), in an accessible, economical and simple way.

My interests were to create something real, useful and accessible, with a real work team,
playing the role of **Project Manager** in that team and collaborating in technical development.

I don't know where the ideas come from, but I do know how Fuddy came about and I think I know how it's going to turn out ;).
